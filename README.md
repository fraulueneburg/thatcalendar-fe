# ðŸ‘Œ [IN PROGRESS] thatCalendar â€“ ~~simple~~ timeboxing experiment

Well, that escalated quickly. What initially started as a way to display and bugfix corrupted ical data, became an entire timeboxing app in just a matter of days. I may have taken the whole scratching-your-own-itch (= building-my-own-tools) thing a bit too far. But then again: Itâ€™s too much fun to stop.

I am learning a lot about date conversion (love you, [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/)! ðŸ’œ) and the complexity of something as seemingly simple as a calendar. Also spend way too much time crafting my own Notion-like combobox. The things you do for love, right?
